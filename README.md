# EcMOdel

#### Our goal is to develop a machine learning prediction algorithm for neurological injury in pediatric cardiac patients.

The biggest risk factor for Pediatric EcMo patients is stroke.  We have built a framework to statistically assess actionable events leading to stroke and improve neurological outcomes.
